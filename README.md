ConstructorsDemo - A demo of constructors, overloading and this() to call the empty constructor from an overloaded one.

ConstructorInheritance - A demo of how to use base with constructors of inherited classes. 

DowncastingDemo - Shows a real world example of downcasting, in this case converting a sender object to a Button.

Extensibility - Takes a look at extensibility with interfaces

FieldsDemoReadonly - Demo of how to initialise an array in a class outside a constructor and make it readonly so the data isn't lost.

FilterStringOutOfList - An array is passed containing int and string. The objective is to return an int array of just the ints, removing the strings.

FindShortestString - A string is passed, the objective is to find the shortest word and return an int of its length.

Indexers - Using keys to find and add values to a Dictionary datatype.

Inheritance - Simple Inheritance program to see how funtionality is inherited from the parent to the child.

MethodsDemo - Overloading, signatures and params.

Regex - Check the pin introduced in 4 or 6 characters. 

Testability - Shows how interfaces help with unit tests.
